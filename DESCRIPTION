Title: goldmine: Genomic context annotation for any set of genomic
    ranges using UCSC Genome Browser tables
Description: Goldmine obtains data by direct downloading and updating of a
    local mirror of select UCSC Genome Browser annotation tables. The R package
    contains functions to assess genomic context of any given set of genomic
    ranges by performing overlaps with regions of annotated genomic features
    and produce long, short, and plot outputs.
