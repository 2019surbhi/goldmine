Title: goldmine: Genomic context annotation for any set of genomic
    ranges using UCSC Genome Browser tables
Description: Goldmine obtains data by direct downloading and updating of a local
    mirror of select UCSC Genome Browser annotation tables. The R package contains
    functions to assess genomic context of any given set of genomic ranges by
    performing overlaps with regions of annotated genomic features and produce long,
    short, and plot outputs. There are also functions for performing enrichment
    testing by drawing background sets matched for multiple variables (i.e., length,
    CpG density, etc).
